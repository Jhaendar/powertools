# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A frontend-only developer tools website built with React that provides a collection of small, useful utilities for developers. The website will be hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access and designed with an extensible architecture to easily add new tools. The initial release will include three core tools: JSON to string conversion, JSON visualizer, and CSV table viewer.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert JSON to string and vice versa, so that I can quickly format data for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I paste JSON data into the input field THEN the system SHALL display the stringified version in the output field
2. WHEN I paste a JSON string into the input field THEN the system SHALL parse and display the formatted JSON in the output field
3. WHEN I provide invalid JSON THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN I click a copy button THEN the system SHALL copy the output to my clipboard
5. WHEN I clear the input THEN the system SHALL clear the output automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to visualize JSON data in a tree structure, so that I can better understand complex nested data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I paste JSON data into the visualizer THEN the system SHALL display it as an expandable/collapsible tree structure
2. WHEN I click on a node THEN the system SHALL expand or collapse that branch
3. WHEN I provide invalid JSON THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN viewing large JSON objects THEN the system SHALL handle performance gracefully with lazy loading or virtualization
5. WHEN I want to copy a specific value THEN the system SHALL provide copy functionality for individual nodes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view CSV data in a table format with configurable row limits, so that I can quickly inspect large CSV files without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload or paste CSV data THEN the system SHALL display it in a table format
2. WHEN the CSV has many rows THEN the system SHALL initially load only a configurable number of rows (default 50)
3. WHEN I want to see more rows THEN the system SHALL provide a "Load More" button to incrementally load additional rows
4. WHEN the CSV has headers THEN the system SHALL detect and display them as table headers
5. WHEN I want to configure the row limit THEN the system SHALL provide a setting to adjust the initial load count
6. WHEN the CSV data is malformed THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily navigate between different tools, so that I can quickly switch between utilities without losing my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the website THEN the system SHALL display a navigation menu with all available tools
2. WHEN I click on a tool in the navigation THEN the system SHALL switch to that tool's interface
3. WHEN I switch between tools THEN the system SHALL preserve my input data in each tool
4. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive navigation experience
5. WHEN I bookmark a specific tool THEN the system SHALL support direct URLs for each tool

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the website, I want to easily add new tools, so that I can expand the utility collection with minimal code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to add a new tool THEN the system SHALL require only creating a new component and adding it to a tools registry
2. WHEN I add a new tool THEN the system SHALL automatically include it in the navigation menu
3. WHEN I add a new tool THEN the system SHALL automatically generate the appropriate routing
4. WHEN I add a new tool THEN the system SHALL follow consistent UI patterns and styling
5. WHEN I add a new tool THEN the system SHALL support the same URL structure as existing tools

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to work reliably on GitHub Pages, so that I can access it from anywhere without setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website is deployed THEN the system SHALL work correctly on GitHub Pages static hosting
2. WHEN I access the website THEN the system SHALL load quickly with optimized bundle sizes
3. WHEN I refresh the page on any tool THEN the system SHALL handle client-side routing correctly
4. WHEN I access the website from different devices THEN the system SHALL be fully responsive
5. WHEN I use the website offline after initial load THEN the system SHALL continue to function for client-side operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive interface, so that I can focus on using the tools efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit any tool THEN the system SHALL display a clear, uncluttered interface using shadcn/ui components
2. WHEN I use input fields THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate placeholders and labels with consistent shadcn/ui styling
3. WHEN I perform actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback using shadcn/ui interactive components
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful, non-technical error messages using shadcn/ui alert components
5. WHEN I use the website THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and behavior across all tools using Tailwind CSS utility classes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the website, I want to use a consistent design system, so that the interface remains cohesive and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I build components THEN the system SHALL use shadcn/ui as the primary component library
2. WHEN I style components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
3. WHEN I add new tools THEN the system SHALL follow shadcn/ui design patterns and Tailwind CSS conventions
4. WHEN I need custom components THEN the system SHALL extend shadcn/ui components while maintaining design consistency
5. WHEN I update the design THEN the system SHALL leverage Tailwind's configuration system for theme customization

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the website, I want to have automated UI testing capabilities, so that I can ensure the interface works correctly across different scenarios and browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run UI tests THEN the system SHALL use Playwright MCP tool for browser automation and testing
2. WHEN I test user interactions THEN the system SHALL simulate real user behavior including clicks, typing, and navigation
3. WHEN I test responsive design THEN the system SHALL verify functionality across different viewport sizes
4. WHEN I test tool functionality THEN the system SHALL validate that JSON conversion, visualization, and CSV viewing work correctly
5. WHEN I run tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback on test results and any failures

#### Development Environment Setup

**Dev Server:** Start the development server with `npm run dev` or `npm start` (both run `vite`)
**Browser Testing:** Use Playwright MCP tool for automated browser testing and UI validation
**Testing Workflow:** Start dev server first, then use Playwright MCP to navigate and test the running application
